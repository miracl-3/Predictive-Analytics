# Naïve Bayes Classification

This project applies the **Naïve Bayes classification algorithm** to solve a business-oriented prediction problem using structured data. The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.

## Objective

To build a probabilistic classification model that predicts outcomes based on input features, supporting data-driven decision-making in business contexts such as customer behavior analysis or risk prediction.

## Workflow

The analysis follows these key steps:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data structure, distributions, and relationships
* Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
* Feature selection and preparation for modeling
* Training a Naïve Bayes classifier
* Evaluating model performance using standard classification metrics

## Model Used

* Naïve Bayes Classifier

This model is chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness on high-dimensional datasets with conditional independence assumptions.

## Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score

These metrics are used to assess model performance in a business-relevant manner.

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* pandas, NumPy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib, seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome

The project demonstrates how Naïve Bayes can be effectively applied to classification problems, providing interpretable results and actionable insights despite its simplifying assumptions.
