# K-Means Clustering Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of **unsupervised machine learning** using K-Means clustering to identify meaningful patterns and segments within a dataset.

## Objective

To group data points into distinct clusters based on similarity, enabling better understanding of underlying structures and supporting data-driven business decisions such as customer segmentation or behavioral analysis.

## Workflow

The notebook follows a structured analytical process:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and relationships
* Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling
* Application of K-Means clustering
* Selection of optimal number of clusters using appropriate evaluation techniques
* Interpretation and visualization of cluster characteristics

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* pandas, NumPy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib, seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome

The analysis results in clearly defined clusters with interpretable characteristics, demonstrating how unsupervised learning can be used to extract actionable insights from unlabeled data.
