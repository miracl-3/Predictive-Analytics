# Predictive Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases end-to-end predictive analytics projects focused on solving real-world business problems using data. Each project follows a structured workflow from business understanding to actionable recommendations, with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and business impact.

The portfolio is organized by **business domain**, with each domain containing practical use cases implemented using industry-standard machine learning techniques.

## Business Domains

### 1. Customer Analytics

Projects in this domain focus on understanding customer behavior and improving customer-centric decisions such as retention, targeting, and segmentation.

**Business questions addressed:**

* Which customers are likely to churn?
* What factors contribute most to customer attrition?
* How can customers be grouped based on behavioral patterns?

**Methods and techniques:**

* Classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

---

### 2. Operations & Demand Planning

This domain focuses on operational efficiency and forecasting challenges commonly found in supply chain and demand planning environments.

**Business questions addressed:**

* How accurately can future demand be predicted?
* Which variables drive demand fluctuations?
* How can predictive models support inventory and capacity planning?

**Methods and techniques:**

* Supervised learning models
* Time-based feature engineering
* Model comparison and error analysis
* Translation of forecasts into operational insights

---

### 3. Risk Analysis & Segmentation

Projects in this domain aim to uncover hidden structures, risks, and behavioral segments within data to support strategic decision-making.

**Business questions addressed:**

* How can entities be segmented based on behavior or risk profile?
* What characteristics differentiate high-risk or high-value groups?
* How can unsupervised learning improve business understanding?

**Methods and techniques:**

* K-Means clustering
* Data normalization and scaling
* Segment profiling and interpretation
* Business insight generation from unsupervised models
